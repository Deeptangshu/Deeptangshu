- 👋 Hi, I’m @Deeptangshu
- 👀 I am a Data Science Enthusiast with a passion in music. I wish to bridge the gap between the psychoacoustics of Humankind and machines, making music accessible and understandable to each and everyone, where there is no gap of language and genre
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to handle data and use it in a more efficient way
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which incorporate blockchain into music
- 📫 Reach out to me on my Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/deeptangshu-paul-061247183/
